    "what is billcut": "Sure! BillCut is a financial platform that helps you manage and reduce your existing debt. We partner with NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) to refinance your high-interest credit card bills and personal loans into affordable EMIs. This makes your repayments easier and more predictable. We also offer a debt settlement service for people going through tough financial situations. Would you like me to explain how settlement works too?",  
    "how does billcut pay credit card": "Absolutely. BillCut, through its lending partners, helps you pay off your credit card bill in full. Here‚Äôs how it works: the NBFC transfers funds to your bank account ‚Äî once you receive the money, you pay your credit card bill and show us the proof. Meanwhile, the amount is converted into a single, low-interest EMI which you repay gradually. This process is simple, transparent, and designed to ease your monthly financial load.",
    "what is debt settlement": "Debt settlement is a special service we offer if you're under serious financial stress or facing recovery calls. In this case, BillCut negotiates with your bank or credit card issuer to reduce the total amount you owe ‚Äî up to 50%. Instead of taking a loan, you settle your dues with a one-time payment or structured plan. Please note, while this does impact your credit score, it's a great option if you're struggling to repay the full amount. Want help checking your eligibility?"

If you‚Äôre unsure about what‚Äôs right for your situation, I‚Äôd be happy to guide you through it!",
    "how does billcut pay credit card": "As a quick reminder ‚Äî we don‚Äôt pay the card directly. Our lending partner sends money to your bank account, you pay your card bill with it, and then you repay that amount to the NBFC in EMIs. Would you like to get started with your application?",
    "what is debt settlement": "In case you missed it ‚Äî debt settlement is a way to reduce your total dues if you're unable to repay. It‚Äôs not a loan. We negotiate with lenders for you, and if you qualify, it can bring significant relief. Want us to check if you‚Äôre eligible?"
